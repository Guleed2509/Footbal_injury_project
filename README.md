🧠 Football Injury Prediction Project



This project predicts football player injury risk using machine learning.
It combines player performance, injury history, physical metrics, and workload into a predictive model that supports:

Coaches → manage player workload and rotation
Medical staff → monitor recovery and re injury risk
Analysts → identify key contributors to injuries
The system uses a hybrid ML pipeline and is built in Python / scikit-learn.

🎯 Project Goals
Build a machine learning pipeline to predict injuries before the next match
Support data-driven decisions in training & rotation
Provide actionable risk scores for every player
Explore the ethical & societal impact of injury prediction
Document workflow according to AI professional standards
